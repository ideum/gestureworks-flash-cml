# GestureWorks Flash CML 

GestureWorks Flash CML framework

Creative Markup Language (CML) is an XML-based open standard for defining object creation, management, and interaction 
within a multiuser, mulititouch environment. It is the official markup language for authoring GestureWorks Flash and 
Open Exhibits applications. The goals of CML are to create reusable and sharable ux models that are programming 
language-agnostic and to accelerate the development of multiuser, multitouch applications.
