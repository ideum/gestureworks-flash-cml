# GestureWorks Flash CML Framework

[Creative Markup Language (CML)](http://www.creativeml.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) is an XML-based open standard for defining object creation, management, and interaction within a multiuser, mulititouch environment. It is the official markup language for authoring [GestureWorks Flash](http://gestureworks.com/pages/flash-home) and [Open Exhibits](http://openexhibits.org/) applications. The goals of CML are to create reusable and sharable UX models that are programming language-agnostic and to accelerate the development of multiuser, multitouch applications.
