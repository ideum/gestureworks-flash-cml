# GestureWorks Flash CML 

Gestureworks Flash Creative Markup Language (CML) framework

Creative Markup Language (CML) is an XML-based open standard for defining object creation, management, and interaction 
within a multiuser, mulititouch environment. It is the official markup language for authoring GestureWorks Flash and

language-agnostic and to accelerate the development of multiuser, multitouch applications.
